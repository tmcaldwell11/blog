	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Teresa and welcome to my blog! I’m kind of newish to coding. I made a complete career 360 and attended a coding bootcamp in January 2017. Shortly after finishing up my bootcamp, I landed my first front-end web developer job. Now I’m currently working as a contractor in a web developer role. I still have SOOOO much to learn and will be sharing my experience on this blog!</p>
