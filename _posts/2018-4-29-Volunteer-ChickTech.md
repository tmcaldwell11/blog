Last weekend I had the opportunity to volunteer with ChickTech Charlotte’s first high school workshop. It was really an awesome experience seeing these young ladies planning, designing, and coding their very own websites for the first time. It was a long day and a lot to take in. Even I was dreading having to wake up so early on a Saturday and spending my entire day inside, especially with the weather getting so nice lately. I surprisingly had a great time. Not only did I learn a thing or two about UX/UI design but also I learned about a few resources that would even help me during my own coding journey. 

These high school girls though! Probably sounds cheesy but they were amazing! They had such great ideas and all so creative in their own ways. Not to mention they pushed through a whole Saturday with us to learn the different aspects of technology. There were a few girls who were comfortable with coding but for the most part, the majority of the girls were really nervous about learning technology...which really surprised me. I assume that with all the movements and clubs around pushing for more girls to get into tech that they wouldn’t feel so nervous about it. I hope they walked away learning a few great things and feeling more confident in their technology skills. I’d definitely love to volunteer with this organization again.
