  I've finally finished enough of my blog to not be completely embarrassed by it! It literally feels like I’ve been working on this FOREVER! For reference, I started it in October and I told myself this blog was a work in progress. This weekend I hit a wall BUT I really wanted to challenge myself to finish what I could to make it presentable.

There were a few times I thought I should just give up!  This is dumb!  Why would I frustrate myself like this when I could just use a free Wordpress template with significantly less stress? I was so frustrated but I really wanted to figure this out for myself, so I could customize my blog exactly how I wanted. I’m familiar with Ruby and Git, so I just needed to stay focused! I kept thinking why can’t I figure this out?! Why are there soooo many 404 pages!? All my links are broken! My images won’t post! Nothing works! I was so irritated that I just ended up deleting the entire repository and going to bed. Then waking up the next morning and starting completely over. I’m actually pretty glad I did that. What’s that saying? The best debugger is a good nights rest. So true! I wish I had bookmarked the other blogs I found that helped me work through the code and of course Stack Overflow. I’m just so proud of myself right now! I still need to tidy up my code quite a bit but for now, I am pleased with my effort.

Also, it’s a slow week with the upcoming holidays and everyone being out BUT I got some big tasks ahead of me at work!  I’ll be taking on incoming projects that come in this week but I’m not sure the likely hood of that happening, considering things are wrapping up for the year! I’m a little nervous but excited about the challenge. Hopefully, I'll remember all the processes! Looking forward to relaxing a bit for Christmas and then cutting loose for NYE!
